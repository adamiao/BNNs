%\section*{\underline{\textbf{Introduction}}}

In this report I'll explain an implementation of a gradient boosting algorithm where the weak learner of interest is a neural network. This is more of an academic exercise than anything else. I will be using the ``Iris Flower Dataset'' as the data analyzed by this method. This machine learning technique will be used primarily for classification. In this small report I'll be doing only the derivation of the boosted side of things and later showing a pseudocode for the algorithm itself.
